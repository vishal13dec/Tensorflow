BasicTutorial

Tensorflow has emerged as the most popular Deep Learning library in the last couple of years .It has been created by Google Brain Team which supports distributed computing.

-> The surge in the computational power of the computers in the recent years has leveraged the scientific community to realize the theories of mathematics and develop application based on top of it.It has helped to develop intelligent softwares which can identify images , translate language , play games and many more activities which requires human level intelligence.

-> The other popular Deep learning libraries are Theano , Torch .

Currently, enterprises around the world is investing heavily to leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence to optimise their business and better cater services to their clients.

Some of the popular areas of applications of Deep Learning are :
<br>          1. Image Recognition
<br>          2. Image Detection
<br>          3. Speech To Text
<br>          4. Language Translation
<br>          5. Natural Language Processing
<br>          6. Development Of Softwares and Intelligent system which can perform the human activities like self driving
                 cars,Drones etc
